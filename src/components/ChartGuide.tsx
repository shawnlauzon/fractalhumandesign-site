          Congratulations on taking the first step to understanding yourself and
          how absolutely, incredibly unique you are! My goal is to give you some
          basic wisdom to help you live a life in alignment with your authentic

          Some of what you read might resonate with you, and others not so much.
          This is normal: most of us have been conditioned over time to be
          someone we aren't, and so it can be hard to recognize our true nature.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          Why is that? Well our parents, doing their best, wanted to guide us by
          their own experiences. Unfortunately, what worked for them is often
          different from what we need. We are all different! But our parents,
          they being our only source of love as a child, we would do absolutely
          anything not lose it ... even if that means going against our very
          nature. And this process of "fitting in" repeats itself at school,
          when we're looking for a job, or looking a partner.

          Human Design gives us tools to let go of this conditioning from all
          these influences, both those trying to help us or do us harm. These
          tools bring us back to our true nature: that each of these bodies are
          different and how to trust the guidance we receive daily.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          One final suggestion: treat everything you read here as an opportunity
          to experiment. Try it out, see how it works, and then take it or leave
          it; don't believe anything that anyone tells you, even what you read
          here! Enjoy the process. Let go of what you <em>think</em> you need to
          do and relax into your body's wisdom.

          You have the strengths needed to be successful. Your strengths are
          different from other people's, and so it can be easy to compare with
          others and want what they have. But Human Design shows us how we are
          unique and that there's absolutely no point comparing yourself to
          anyone else. It's like comparing yourself to a cheetah: it's not your
          fault that you can't run as fast.

          However, some people get massive value by hearing it directly from
          someone who has been practicing it for years. I am available to answer

          based on your chart.

          People study the system for years and only begin to understand all the

          the more detailed information. You now have the informaetion you need
