                I used to be frustrated constantly. I would compare myself to
                others and beat myself up because I wasn't as successful as they
                were. I would look outside myself for answers, and when they
                didn't work for me, I would get even more frustrated and beat
                myself up even more!

                Now as a certified Human Design for Business (BG5) consultant, I
                teach you strategies to move yourself from frustrated, bitter,
                and angry to successful, satisfied, and at peace. I focus on
                practical tools which you can use immediately, rather than
                giving you a bunch of theory which you will immediately forget.
                Life will never be the same again.
