          <p className="mt-8">
            We start with a look at the type of career which most aligns with
            your unique nature. Broadly speaking there are four different types
            of careers. None of them are more important than others, and each is
            critical to the process of creation.
          </p>

          <div className="mt-8 flow-root">
            <div className="-mx-4 -my-2 overflow-x-auto sm:-mx-6 lg:-mx-8">
              <div className="inline-block min-w-full py-2 align-middle sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
                <CareerTypeTable />
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p className="mt-8">
            Each career type has positive and more challenging aspects, based on
            their individual nonverbal energy. Since it is based on what is
            intrinsically you, rather than personal skills or preferences, it's
            more integral than the "career guidance" you might have received in
            high school. When working in alignment with your broad career type,
            you're more likely to feel in flow.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6">
            Unfortunately people try to be a type they are not. For example, the
            coaching industry (an Advisor-style career) has seen massive growth,
            leading some Builders (myself included) to try to teach others
            rather than looking to do what they love. Builders who do this are
            frequently frustrated. Meanwhile when Advisors, who don't have the
            same consistent level of energy as Builders do, try to keep up with
            Builders, they will tend to feel exhausted.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6">
            Now that you have a general sense of the types, we can talk about

                BTW, many people are confused by what exactly is a "Manifesting

                The biggest difference in practice is that when building,
                Express Builders tend to skip steps while Classic Builders are
                more methodical.

                You're probably not used to so much waiting. You might even feel

                behind. Or maybe even feel like you're being lazy! But waiting
                is not just sitting around, waiting for something to happen.

                So many people think that waiting is a stagnant sort of dead
                space. You know, nothing is happening, nothing is going on,
                nothing's ever going on ... It doesn't mean that nothing is
                going on. Waiting can be translated as a higher state of
                alertness ... It is a state of awareness. It is being present.
                It is being ready for precisely those things that you're
                actually waiting for, waiting for that perfect stimulation that
                is going to allow you to operate correctly, to make a decision
                correctly, because you're present here now, waiting you.

            You have the strengths needed to be successful. Your strengths are
            different from other people's, and so it can be easy to compare with
            others and want what they have. But Human Design shows us how we are
            unique and that there's absolutely no point comparing yourself to
            anyone else. It's like comparing yourself to a cheetah: it's not
            your fault that you can't run as fast.
